#### November 11, 2021

* responsive design (bootstrap?)
* figure out why (mathOptionGPA.js ln 19) doesn't work
* Keep Year - 3 year Math / 5 year English limit (ADD TO MULTIPLE MEASURES DROPDOWN AND SAT TEXT INPUT)
* connect date to all clones instead of just first (low-priority; don't get a headache over it)
