##### notes from reqts meeting (haven't figured these out yet)

* sat scores - switch years for math and english

* gpa- if left blank what happens? is it optional?

* accuplacer score - if any one score is left blank, will that be a problem?

* ask when they took it, >5 years then they have to retake it (like SAT)
  
* high school drop down - list for each course offered at selected high school
  
* or have them input the title of the course they took if not listed (like high school dropdown)
  
* high schools change the titles of their courses- this would make it so we don't have to update the courses for each high school
  
* as much user friendly language as possible for the drop down
  
* put "recommend courses based on what you have entered" somewhere on the bottom - disclaimer that this is not an official document
  
* transfer / non-native speaker - add if they have taken any college credits in the past (they wouldn't consider themselves as a transfer student since some adults start college and don't finish them)
  
* morris has a list of different courses from the schools, she's emailing them to prof gamrat
